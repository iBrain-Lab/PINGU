Preprint:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08337

Setup:
1) Set up python environment:
conda env create -f environment.yml
NOTE: the nnunet code may need to be installed separately with pip. pip install nnunet==1.7.0

2) Download PINGU weights:

https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/PINGU_Weights/27176523?file=49632888

3) Set up nnUNet with PINGU weights:
import_nnunet.sh

4) Put T1 images in a single folder. All images must end with _0000.nii.gz (nnUNet constraints, sorry)

5) run PINGU:
run_pingu.sh
